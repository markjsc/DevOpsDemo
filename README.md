# DevOps Demo
A demo project showing a full DevOps pipeline - automated build, test, and deployment

## Roadmap

- **Enhance the project**: This project was started using the standard Visual Studio ASP.NET MVC template. It could stand to be updated with some of the more current features (i.e. [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com), [Angular](https://angular.io), etc).
- **Add Demo Content**: The content for the web project will not include anything too impressive. It's only intended to serve as a demo to enable the DevOps functionality.
- **Unit Testing**: Make sure the little bit of logic that lives in the Web project and any additinal liraries is fully tested.
- **Integration Testing**: Add some automated integration testing. Details are TBD.
- **Automated Build**: Create an automated build using the Build Pipeline from [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops).
- **Automated Deployment**: Create an automated deployment using Release Management from [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops).
